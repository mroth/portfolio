Canal St. Integers spoofed the [Artisanal][1] [Integer][2] [movement][3] (which in itself was a bit of a parody), where unique integers were provided as a service via API.

The Artisanal Integer movement had played with the notion of authenticity by introducing the notion of fiat "ownership" over a number (even including 3D printing of integers as pseudo certificates of authenticity).

In contrast, Canal St. Integers asserted the value of repurposed culture -- acknowledging that which is desirable in media culture is often so precisely _because_ of it's nonunique status.

In order to do so, Canal St. Integers scraped the Twitter accounts of high-profile celebrities, and then provided a service that reissued the same integers that were used in their tweets.

There was, of course, a fully functional REST API.
