"Selfies for software developers."

Lolcommits spoofed the nascent selfie meme and brought it to software developers by hooking into [git][1], the popular version control software.  Whenever a developer saves their work via `git commit`, lolcommits captures a photo at the exact same time via webcam, and superimposes the commit log over the image lolcat style.

Perhaps paradoxically, lolcommits actually became a quite popular open-source project, sitting at #1 on GitHub Explore for an extended period of time.  It has since been adopted as an "essential" (useless but fun) part of the software development workflow for thousands of software developers and startups alike, and remains in active development.
